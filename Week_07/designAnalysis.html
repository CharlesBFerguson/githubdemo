  <h3>Poorly Designed Sites:</h3>
  <a href='https://www.mopar.com/en-us.html' target='blank'>Mopar.com</a>
  <p>Desktop: No emphasis towards immediate navigation without having to click the hamburger menu or scrolling. Language selector div spanning entire page when it could have been incorporated (unified) within the nav area directly below it. Duplicate images used for differing content, plus they are so large that they take up the entire viewport upon landing, while displaying little to no valuable content without scrolling. All images too large (not much being said on the page while using up a lot of real estate).</p>
  <p>Mobile: Much of the same as above, with an immediate pop-up at the top (landscaped) with an additional pop-up at the bottom at the same time (portait) making it impossible to view any content without engaging these pop-ups.</p>

  <a href='https://jamilin.com/' target='blank'>Jami Lin's Passions</a>
  <p>Dektop/Mobile: NOT SECURE! No natural movement through page. Don't know where to look first, much less what to click. Too busy... glaring absence of negative space. Emphasis attempted to be applied to each element, therby rendering emphasis to NONE of it. Gratuitous use of both color and images. Un-unified filters applied on graphical text elements in header. Page only spans 1/3 of viewport. Still incorporates Flash (broken as well).</p>
  <p><i>Editorial: Looks like this site was designed in the early nineties and then the designer promptly died, thus providing no further design updates.</i></p>
  
  <a href='https://www.columbiacountyga.gov/home' target='blank'>Columbia County, Georgia</a>
  <p>Desktop: Again, everything's so big! Had to check to make sure browser view was at 100%. Had to reduce view to 50% for it to look OK. After reducing, the images that span the page did not reduce proportionately, still spanning the entire page while only decreasing the height. Quick Links at the bottom of the page requiring a lot of scrolling to get see.</p>
  <p>Mobile: While being fairly responsive, some of the elements could have been smaller, particularly in portrait mode.</p>
